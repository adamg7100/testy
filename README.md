# Module 2 Challenge Repository
Recieved assistance from tutor during appointment.  Also implemented some suggestions based on feedback from people outside of the course.  Code is contained on the notepad file, simply copy and paste into Macro.  Technically it is two scripts, but I ran them together through the VB window and they seemed to work OK.  Please let me know if a different format is preferred.
